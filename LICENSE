This software is available under two license models - "Qualifying" (the MIT with two extra bits)"
or Non Qualifying (NonQual). 

You have a choice between the two... 

If you are using this to further Novo Nordisk (doubled the cost of Novolin insulin 
- required to maintain compatiblity with life), you have chosen the NonQual. Likewise 
if furthuring Mylan, mostly due to the quintupling the cost of epi-pen. 

If using this code (in source or object or derivative, etc) is contributing to or 
enabling predatory capitalism (unreasonable profit/extortion, or increasing the cost of life-
necessary products without other reasonable cause) like the aforementioned Novo and Mylan, you choose
the NonQual.

All others get to choose the MIT+

The choice is always available, and always yours.

This part of the license is subject to change.
