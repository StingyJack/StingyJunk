This software is available under two license models - "Qualifying" (the MIT with two extra bits)"
or Non Qualifying (NonQual). 

To qualify for the usual MIT license, you (and your organizaiton if applicable) need to have both 
of the following clauses be not true. 

If using this code to further the profits, success, or interestes of Novo 
Nordisk (who doubled the cost of Novolin insulin that is required by some to maintain compatiblity 
with life), then you are bound by the the NonQual.The same applies to Mylan, due to 
the quintupling the cost of epi-pen.  These two deserve special mention due to the personal impact 
they have. 

If using this code (in source or object or derivative, etc) is contributing to or 
enabling predatory capitalism (unreasonable profit/extortion, or increasing the cost of life-
necessary products without other reasonable cause) like the aforementioned Novo and Mylan, or by 
causing harm to others without making meaningful and reasonable efforts (MnRE) to make amends (Samsung), your usage is 
bound to the NonQual. To avoid getting mired in the subjectivity of what makes MnRE, the ultimate decision on 
what is or is not MnRE will be made by myself or my immediate family. 

If neither of these are true for your intended usage, the Qualifying license applies (and thank you for 
being non-evil human being). 

If either of these are true for your intended usage, the Non Qualifying license applies (and fuck you for being
an evil bastard).


This part of the license is subject to change, but if you are good, you will have nothing to worry about.

----------

Non-Qualifying


You should probably just fuck off at this point because you cannot really use, copy, modify, or even 
look at this code. If you fall into the requirements for this license, and are using any of the
software covered by it, an exception will be made if you provide non-conditioned substantial financial
aid (and volunteer labor) of no less than 20% of the organizations and C-level executive salaries to any 
non-affiliated third parties involved with any of the following efforts...
 - Ensures that every homeless person and animal in the US will have a safe place to live and receive the medical care they need
 - Ensures that every US citizen, and those who's intention or desire is to become a citizen, has access to the same quality
 of food that you would feed your own family.
 - Closes down every animal kill shelter and opens enough no-kill shelters (with any necessary medical care, spay/neuter, etc)
 - anything else that I think has a net positive effect like these. 
 
 Using the software without also meeting these means that you will need to give me the sum that results in 10,000,000,000 USD after taxes, every 5 years, so that I can use it toward the aforementioned efforts.
